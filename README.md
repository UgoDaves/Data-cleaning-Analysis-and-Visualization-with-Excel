In the course of this project, I will conduct comprehensive data analysis leveraging Excel and SQL. 
The objective is to perform data cleaning with Excel, create some visualizations, run SQL queries to derive valuable insights and actionable intelligence from the dataset. 
This analysis will encompass a range of SQL queries, including subqueries, to investigate patterns, correlations, and trends within the data. 
The ultimate goal is to provide a thorough examination of various facets such as customer behavior, product performance, and regional dynamics. 
This data-driven approach will contribute to informed decision-making and strategic planning for optimizing business processes and enhancing overall performance.
